When designing a website, the most important thing to consider is data
storage.  In most cases, the data the application stores is much more
valuable than the application itself, so starting with the data design

We'll be using PostgreSQL for Slab's data storage.  We first add a
Rakefile and a rake task for creating the user and database for Slab.

We'll be using the ruby Sequel library for accessing PostgreSQL.
We first define the table used for data storage via a Sequel migration.
