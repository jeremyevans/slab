Welcome to the Slab tutorial.  This tutorial is going to walk you through
building a simple ruby web application that does OCR (optical character
recognition) on uploaded files.

When designing a website, the most important thing to consider is data
storage.  In most cases, the data the application stores is much more
valuable than the application itself, so starting with the data design
is recommended.

We'll be using PostgreSQL for Slab's data storage.  We first add a
Rakefile and a rake task for creating the user and database for Slab.

We'll be using the ruby Sequel library for accessing PostgreSQL.
We first define the table used for data storage via a Sequel migration.

We'll be using the ruby Roda web framework.  We'll start with a simple
hello world in Roda.

We'll expand on our hello world to use a layout and have a page for
uploading a document image.

We'll start storing uploaded files, without OCRing them.  To do that,
we'll add a Sequel model.

Currently, we aren't showing any of the uploaded documents.  Let's start
doing that.

Let's actually start doing OCR on uploaded documents.  Unfortunately,
the OCR process takes a long time, so you don't want to do it while
handling a request.  Instead, we'll handle it using a background job
system, using PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY.

Now that we can get the text of uploaded files, lets try adding a
search engine, so you can search for text and see the uploaded image.
